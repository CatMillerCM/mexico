# MEXICO PROJECT

Welcome to Mexico's project: Bit-By-Bit Taco Builder.

This project is part of [What's My Country Code](https://whatsmycountrycode.cat-miller.com/), a portfolio of mini-apps I am creating inspired by each country in Latin America I visit on my travels.

Inspired by the numerous taco stalls we came across around MÃ©xico, Bit-By-Bit Taco Builder is an 8-bit style app that pays homage to all the various flavours we found in different states.

Enjoy building up your favourite flavours, or try something new!

A special to [Pixel It](https://giventofly.github.io/pixelit/), a Javascript library that allowed me to pixelate all of the ingredients for each layer.

Hosted independently [here](https://mexico.cat-miller.com/).
A full write up, with further information about the project, can be found on [What's My Country Code - Mexico](https://whatsmycountrycode.cat-miller.com/mexico).
